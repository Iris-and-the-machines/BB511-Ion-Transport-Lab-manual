This is necessary for all recording hardware as resistances and capacitors on the circuit boards change with temperature and make the measurements drift while the hardware is heating up. 3.1 Building and powering up your setup Assemble your chamber by: inserting the slider in between the two chamber halves inserting the chamber in the chamber holder tightening the screw on the side Connect Voltage (V, black cables) and Current (I, red and white cables) electrodes. Connect electrodes to headstage. Make sure V1 and I1 and V2 and I2 are on the same side of the chamber. Fill chamber with Ringer’s solution, insert tubing that feeds air and start the pump. Check that all instrument settings are in the rest setting like on the image below: 3.2 Get familiar with the two measuring modes Your equipment has to be on the rest setting at all times, unless you want to measure something. We will continuously measure voltage and current. For that you have to switch between two instrument settings. Familiarize yourself with both procedures. 3.2.1 Measure Voltage Set the FUNCTION switch to OPEN and METER to VOLTAGE Read the value in the display 3.2.2 Measure Current Set the FUNCTION switch to CLAMP and METER to CURRENT Read the value in the display 3.3 Account for electrode asymmetry Switch FUNCTION to OPEN, and METER to VOLTAGE. The value that is now displayed reflects the asymmetry of the electrodes. Use the OFFSET SWITCH in the plus or minus position and turn the OFFSET DIAL to bring the number on the display to zero. If it doesn’t work, get help. Check for air bubbles in your voltage electrodes (black). 3.4 Account for fluid resistance Function switch still on OPEN, place METER to CURRENT and hold the FLUID RESISTANCE COMPENSATION button down. The values should now be between 60 and 68 µA. If it is lower, your resistance is too high. Get help. Still holding the button switch to voltage mode (OPEN + VOLTAGE). Adjust the fluid resistance compensation dial to bring the number on the display to zero. The value on the dial represents the fluid resistance of your system. I.e. the resistance all fluid parts of the setup together have. Note down the fluid resistance. 3.5 Mount skin sample OBS: After mounting the skin sample, you have to immediately start measuring I and V, so get ready for that first Empty your chamber using the provided syringe. Get a skin sample that was dissected from green frogs ( Rana kl. esculentus ). The skin was dissected from different parts of the frog (e.g. belly, back, leg etc). Note down from which part your skin was. Identify the outer (mucosal) and inner (serosal) side. Mount the skin on the slider of the Ussing chamber. Try to have the mucosal side point to the left halfchamber. It is important to keep track which side points to which half-cell of the chamber! Note down to which side the mucosal side points. Fill fresh Ringer’s solution into both half chambers and ensure that both sides are bubbled. The stream of air bubble serves two purposes: it provides oxygen and mixing of the Ringer’s solution. Check for leaks. Check for air bubbles in the chamber and specifically on the skin. Start your stopwatch. "],["experiment-1-determine-the-epithelial-resistance.html", "Chapter 4 Experiment 1: Determine the epithelial resistance 4.1 Take measurements 4.2 Data analysis 4.3 Discussion", " Chapter 4 Experiment 1: Determine the epithelial resistance You will now measure the potential difference over the skin (from now on referred to as V) as well as the current needed to even out the potential difference between both sides (from now on referred to as I). This current is also called ”short circuit current”. I is a measure of ion transport across the skin. 4.1 Take measurements Measure V and I every minute for 10 minutes after mounting the skin. Measure V and note it in your excel sheet. Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Repeat for 10 minutes in 1 minute intervals. When not taking measurements, always switch to ZERO. 4.2 Data analysis The value we would like to measure is the resistance of the skin, so we need to calculate the measurements you made. Use Ohm’s law to calculate the electrical resistance R of the skin. Make sure to get the unit right. 4.3 Discussion Once you have calculated the reistance, try to answer the questions below. We will discuss them in the group, and you will use them to guide your data discussion for the report. What does the epithelial resistance reflect? What is the unit of the resistance? How can we make it more comparable across experiments? How are these parameters called? Do the values change over time? What can we conclude from that? What is the mechanism behind our observations? Why?

To achieve this, you will measure I for a series of diluted Ringer’s solutions. The 1x Ringers you used so far was 112 mM NaCl. 5.1 Preparation What is the concentration of Na+-ions in 1x Ringer’s? To test if the ion transport depends on the concentration of Na+-ions, we will need the following solutions: Calculate the different concentrations of Na+-ions yourself and enter them in the excel sheet. Plan how to prepare 200 mL of each of these solutions from 1x or 2x Ringer’s. Once you have a plan find an instructor to help you make the solutions. 5.2 Take measurements Empty chamber Using the 0x solution, wash the chamber on the mucosal side 3 times (wait 2 minutes in-between). Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Empty the chamber and add the solution with the next higher concentration. Wait 1 minute Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Repeat step 4-6 for each of the solutions in order of increasing Na+-ion concentration. At the end go back to 1x Ringer’s! 5.3 Data Analysis Convert I to the flux of Na+-ions (J) using the following relationship (F: Farraday constant): \\(J_{Na^+} = \\frac {I_{Na^+}}{F} = \\frac {1\\frac {C} {s}} {96500 \\frac {C} {mol}}\\) Plot J as a function of Na+-concentration. 5.4 Discussion Have you seen a curve like that before? What is it called? What kind of information can you extract from these curves? "],["experiment-3-influence-of-chloride-ions.html", "Chapter 6 Experiment 3: Influence of chloride ions 6.1 Take measurements 6.2 Discussion", " Chapter 6 Experiment 3: Influence of chloride ions In this experiment, you investigate whether overall ion exchange over the membrane includes chloride ions. To characterize the anion transport, you will use “Sulfate - Ringer’s solution” on the mucosal side of the skin. In “Sulfate - Ringer’s”, chloride ions are replaced with SO42- ions. To compare normal ringers to Sulfate-Ringers, we will take the average of 5 measurements 6.1 Take measurements Empty chamber on mucosal side. Using 1x Ringer’s, wash the chamber on the mucosal side 3 times (wait 2 minutes in-between). Measure V and note it in your excel sheet. Measure I and note it in your excel sheet.

A CSV file is simply a text file, where columns are separated by one sign and the decimal point is indicated by another. In English speaking countries and most scientific data you can download from the internet, columns are separated by a comma “,” and the decimal point is a “.”. The default in other European countries, including Denmark, is to use a semikolon “;” to separate columns and a comma “,” as decimal point. Depending on which settings your computer follows, you will have to read in csv files using two different functions: Reading in data from “Danish files”: data &lt;- read.csv2(&quot;folder/myfile.csv&quot;) Reading in data from “English files”: data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;folder/myfile.csv&quot;) Many errors are related to this step. See 9.2.1 9.1.2 Set your working directory to a different folder The working directory is the place “where R works from” at the moment. Files that are in that folder can be used by simply using their file name. If you need to change to a different folder, there are two ways: 1. commandline setwd(&quot;C:/Users/new/path/to/folder/you/want&quot;) Using R studio interface Go to “Files” Navigate to the folder you want to use as new working directory Click on the settings wheel Click “Select As Working Directory” Done :) 9.1.3 Write and troubleshoot a new script Think about what you want the code to do. Identify the functions that you need. Start writing your code. Check if the code did what you expected after every step. The last step is really important. You can run scripts without ever seeing your data and R will do whatever you tell it, no matter whether it makes sense or not. When writing new code, it is vital to check the result after each step. Usefull check are: Simply view the data table or object you work on to see the result of your code View(df) Check if the table or column has the right type of data in it. str() tells you what kind of table df is, how many rows (the number of objects) and columns (the number of variables) there are, and what type of data is in the columns. It is a very useful tool for troubleshooting: - Does your data frame have the right amount of columns? Lets say you calculated a new variable and wrote it into a column, then there should be one more than before - Does your data frame have the right amount of rows? - Is the data in the right format? “chr” means that the column is a character column, which means it is regarded as text. Even if the signs are numbers, R will not be able to use the column for calculations. str(df) 9.1.4 Change the type of data in a column Most commonly you want to do this if R has read in data as “character” (text), but you need it to be “numeric” (numbers). Of note: Typically, if you have a column that should be numeric but isn’t, then there is a problem when reading in the data or creating the column taht should be solved. Changing a column from “character” to “numeric”: df$col &lt;- as.numeric(data$col) #Takes the column &quot;col&quot; in the table df, formats it as number and overwrites it with itself. 9.2 Common error messages and how to solve them 9.2.1 Cannot open the connection The error When you try to read in a csv file you get the error message below: read.csv(&quot;data2.csv&quot;) ## Warning in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open file &#39;data2.csv&#39;: No such file or directory ## Error in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open the connection Why is this happening? You just told R to open a file in your working directory that is called data2.csv. R is telling you it can’t do that because the file doesn’t exist. The two major reasons for this are: 1. The file is in a different folder. 2. You mistyped the filename. Troubleshooting Check where your current working directory is set to. getwd() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/irisadam/Dropbox/TEACHING/BB511/2025/Labs/L4/Manual ion transport lab exercise&quot; Is the file in the working directory? Yes: check for correct spelling. No: Either use the path to the file in the command OR change the working directory to the folder where the file is in as described in 9.1.2. 9.2.2 My code doesn’t do what it should or fails with cryptic message "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
