To characterize the anion transport, you will use “Sulfate - Ringer’s solution” on the mucosal side of the skin. In “Sulfate - Ringer’s”, chloride ions are replaced with SO42- ions. To compare normal ringers to Sulfate-Ringers, we will take the average of 5 measurements 6.1 Take measurments Empty chamber on mucosal side. Using 1x Ringer’s, wash the chamber on the mucosal side 3 times (wait 2 minutes in-between). Measure V and note it in your excel sheet. Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Repeat (step 3-4 for) 4 times in 1 minute intervals. Empty chamber on mucosal side. Using Sulfate Ringer’s, wash the chamber on the mucosal side 3 times (wait 2 minutes in-between). Measure V and note it in your excel sheet. Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Repeat (step 8-9 for) 4 times in 1 minute intervals. Switch back to 1x Ringer’s before you continue. Wash 3 times again. 6.2 Data Analysis in R Calculate Resistivity, Current density and resistance for both conditions data3$R &lt;- data3$V / data3$I data3$R_cm2 &lt;- data3$R / 0.71 data3$I_cm2 &lt;- data3$I / 0.71 Take the average of all values from one condition data3_av &lt;- aggregate(list(av_V = data3$V, av_R_cm2 = data3$R_cm2, av_I_cm2 = data3$I_cm2), list(data3$condition), FUN = mean ) data3_sd &lt;- aggregate(list(sd_V = data3$V, sd_R_cm2 = data3$R_cm2, sd_I_cm2 = data3$I_cm2), list(data3$condition), FUN = sd ) data3_mean &lt;- cbind(data3_av, data3_sd[2:4]) Plot the data plot(c(1,2), data3_mean$av_V, ylim = c(0,45)) arrows(c(1,2),data3_mean$av_V - data3_mean$sd_V , c(1,2),data3_mean$av_V + data3_mean$sd_V, code=3, length=0.02, angle = 90) 6.3 Discussion What happened after changing the buffer?
