To achieve this, you will measure I for a series of diluted Ringer’s solutions. The 1x Ringers you used so far was 113 mM NaCl. 5.1 Preparation What is the concentration of Na+-ions in 1x Ringer’s? To test if the ion transport depends on the concentration of Na+-ions, we will need the following solutions: Calculate the different concentrations of Na+-ions yourself and enter them in the excel sheet. Plan how to prepare 200 mL of each of these solutions from 1x or 2x Ringer’s. Once you have a plan find an instructor to approve and hand you the solutions. 5.2 Take measurements Empty chamber Using the 0x solution, wash the chamber on the mucosal side 3 times (wait 2 minutes in-between). Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Empty the chamber and add the solution with thge next higher concentration. Wait 1 minute Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Repeat step 4-6 for each of the solutions in order of increasing Na+-ion concentration. At the end go back to 1x Ringer’s! 5.3 Data Analysis in R part 1 Convert I to the flux of Na+-ions (J) using the following relationship (F: Farraday constant): \\(J_{Na^+} = \\frac {I_{Na^+}}{F} = \\frac {1\\frac {C} {s}} {96500 \\frac {C} {mol}}\\) data2$J &lt;- (data2$I/1000000)/(96500) Plot J as a function of Na+-concentration. plot(x = data2$Na_concentration, y = data2$J, xlab = expression(&quot;Na&quot;^&quot;+&quot;*&quot;-concentration (mmol/L)&quot;), ylab = expression(&quot;Na&quot;^&quot;+&quot;* &quot;-flux (mol/s)&quot;)) Figure 5.1: Transport kinetics of the frog skin 5.4 Discussion part 1 Have you seen a curve like that before? What is it called? What kind of information can you extract from these curves? 5.5 Data Analysis in R part 2 Together: use two methods to extract Vmax and Km. Nonlinear curve fitting to the MM-curve. Generate a Lineweaver Burk plot and extract both values. 5.5.1 Nonlinear curve fitting We have to define the equation we want to use. We are using the Michaelis Menten formula: \\(V_0 = \\frac {V_{max} * S}{K_m + S}\\) MMcurve&lt;-formula(J ~ Vmax * Na_concentration / (Km + Na_concentration)) Next we will use the R curve fitting function nls() to find the Vmax and Km that will best fit our measured values to the Michaelis-Menten-equation. For that we have to provide some start values for the function to use. bestfit &lt;- nls(MMcurve, data2, start=list(Vmax = 50, Km = 2)) Now we will calculate the fitted curve for Na+-ion concentrations from 0 mM to 170 mM. Na_conc &lt;- seq(0,170,0.1) J_fitted &lt;- predict(bestfit,list(Na_concentration = Na_conc)) Now we plot our real data and add the fitted values plot(x = data2$Na_concentration, y = data2$J, xlab = &quot;[Na+] (mmol/L)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Na+ flux (mol/s)&quot;) test&lt;-lines(Na_conc, J_fitted) Figure 5.2: Measured versus fitted data Now we only need to extract the values for Vmax and Km from the fitted equation. Vmax &lt;- coef(bestfit)[1] Km &lt;- coef(bestfit)[2] Vmax ## Vmax ## 3.021023e-10 Km ## Km ## 19.41569 5.5.2 Extract Vmax and Km from a Lineweaver-Burk-plot The Lineweaver Burk plot is a linearization of the data to enable using a linear model to find Vmax and Km. This is achieved by taking the inverse of the substrate concentration and the velocity. As 0 will then be transformed to infinity, we have to subtract the 0 measurements of all and then exclude them. data2$I_norm &lt;- data2$I - data2[1,&quot;I&quot;] data2$J_norm &lt;- data2$I_norm/96500 data_inv &lt;- data.frame( inv_S = 1/data2$Na_concentration, inv_v = 1/data2$J_norm) plot(data_inv) To extract Vmax and Km, we use the y-intercept as well as the slope from the linear model. model &lt;- lm(data_inv$inv_v[2:10]~data_inv$inv_S[2:10]) Vm &lt;- 1/model$coefficients[1] Km &lt;- Vm * model$coefficients[2] Vm ## (Intercept) ## 0.0002736285 Km ## (Intercept) ## 13.83527 In R there is also a pckage that does all of the above automatically: library(renz) data &lt;- data.frame( S = data2$Na_concentration, v = data2$J_norm) lb(data[2:10,]) ## $Kms ## [1] 0 ## ## $Vms ## [1] 0 ## ## $R2s ## [1] 0.9808206 ## ## $fitted_parameters ## Km Vm ## 0 0 ## ## $inverse_data ## inv_S inv_v ## 2 0.3540 20531.915 ## 3 0.1770 14191.176 ## 4 0.0885 9278.846 ## 5 0.0295 5160.428 ## 6 0.0221 4269.912 ## 7 0.0111 3860.000 ## 8 0.0088 3683.206 ## 9 0.0071 3711.539 ## 10 0.0059 3799.213 The package rounds all coefficients to two positions after the comma, which is why we get 0 for both. You can inspect the code behind the package with the command below: lb The solution is to multiply J_norm so we get high enough numbers: library(renz) data &lt;- data.frame( S = data2$Na_concentration, v = data2$J_norm*10000000) lb_results &lt;- lb(data[2:10,]) lb_results$fitted_parameters ## Km Vm ## 13.95 2727.17 5.6 Discussion part 2 Collect the results from all groups. Discuss the differences. What does Km express? What does Vmax express? For the report: Give an estimate of how fast the transport (in % of Vmax) takes place when a frog is sitting in its watering hole, with a Na+-concentration of approximately 5 mmol/L.
