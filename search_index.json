I am planning to add a markdown template to write your report, but that hasn’t happened yet :) 1.1 Usage This book will take you through the entire exercise step by step and also contain example data so we can analyze and discuss the results in real time during the course. All code to work with the data is written in code blocks like this: print(&quot;BB511 is awesome!&quot;) You can directly copy the code from these blocks using the copy button in the upper right corner of the block.

Connect electrodes to headstage. Make sure V1 and I1 and V2 and I2 are on the same side of the chamber. Fill chamber with Ringer’s solution, insert tubing that feeds air and start the pump. Switch on the equipment and wait 5 minutes. This is necessary for all recording hardware as resistances and capacitors on the circuit boards change and make the measurements drift while the hardware is heating up. Check that all instrument settings are in the rest setting like on the image below: 3.2 Get familiar with the two measuring modes Your equipment has to be on the rest setting at all times, unless you want to measure something. We will continuously measure Voltage and Current. For that you have to use different switch between two instrument settings. Familiarize yourself with both procedures. 3.2.1 Measure Voltage Set the FUNCTION switch to OPEN and METER to VOLTAGE Read the value in the display Enter V in mV into your Excel table. 3.2.2 Measure I Set the FUNCTION switch to CLAMP and METER to CURRENT Read the value in the display Enter I in µA into your Excel table. 3.3 Account for electrode asymmetry Switch FUNCTION to OPEN, and METER to VOLTAGE. The value that is now displayed reflects the asymmetry of the electrodes. Use the OFFSET SWITCH in the plus or minus position and turn the OFFSET DIAL to bring the number on the display to zero. If it doesn’t work, get help. Check for air bubbles in your voltage electrodes (black). 3.4 Account for fluid resistance Place the METER to CURRENT and hold the FLUID RESISTANCE COMPENSATION button down. The values should now be between 60 and 68 µA. If it is lower, your resistance is too high. Get help. Still holding the button switch to voltage mode (OPEN + VOLTAGE). Adjust the fluid resistance compensation dial to bring the number on the display to zero. The value on the dial represents the fluid resistance of your system. I.e. the resistance all fluid parts of the setup together have. Note down the fluid resistance. 3.5 Mount skin sample OBS: After mounting the skin sample, you have to immediately start measuring I and V, so get ready for that first Empty your chamber using the provided syringe. Get a skin sample that was dissected from green frogs ( Rana kl. esculentus ). The skin was dissected from different parts of the frog (e.g. belly, back, leg etc). Note down from which part your skin was. Identify the outer (mucosal) and inner (serosal) side. Mount the skin on the slider of the Ussing chamber. Try to have the mucosal side point to the left halfchamber. It is important to keep track which side points to which half-cell of the chamber! Note down to which side the mucosal side points. Fill fresh Ringer’s solution into both half chambers and ensure that both sides are bubbled. The stream of air bubble serves two purposes: it provides oxygen and mixing of the Ringer’s solution. Check for leaks. Check for air bubbles in the chamber and specifically on the skin. Start your stopwatch. "],["experiment-1-determine-the-epithelial-resistance.html", "Chapter 4 Experiment 1: Determine the epithelial resistance 4.1 Take measurements 4.2 Data analysis 4.3 Discussion", " Chapter 4 Experiment 1: Determine the epithelial resistance You will now measure the potential difference over the skin (from now on referred to as V) as well as the current needed to even out the potential difference between both sides (from now on referred to as I). This current is also called ”short circuit current”. I is a measure of ion transport across the skin. 4.1 Take measurements Measure V and I every minute for 10 minutes after mounting the skin. Measure V and note it in your excel sheet. Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Repeat for 10 minutes in 1 minute intervals. When not taking measurements, always switch to ZERO. 4.2 Data analysis The value we would like to measure is the resistance of the skin, so we need to calculate the measurements you made. Read your data into R data1 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Path to the csv&quot;) Use Ohm’s law to calculate the electrical resistance R of the skin. Make sure to get the unit right. data1$R &lt;- (data1$V*1000)/data1$I Plot I, V and R over time. plot(x = data1$time, y = data1$V, xlab = &quot;Time (min)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Potential difference (mV)&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;, ylim = c(0, max(data1$V))) (#fig:Plot 1)Potential difference over time plot(x = data1$time, y = data1$I, xlab = &quot;Time (min)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Current (µA)&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;, ylim = c(0, max(data1$I))) (#fig:Plot 2)Current over time plot(x = data1$time, y = data1$R, xlab = &quot;Time (min)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Resistance (kOhm) &quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;, ylim = c(0, max(data1$R))) (#fig:Plot 3)Resistance over time 4.3 Discussion Once you are done with your data analysis, try to answer the questions below. We will discuss them in the group, and you will use them to guide your data discuaaion for the report. What does the epithelial resistance reflect? What is the unit of the resistance? How can we make it more comparable across experiments? How are these parameters called? Do the values change over time? What can we conclude from that? What is the mechanism behind our observations? Why?

To achieve this, you will measure I for a series of diluted Ringer’s solutions. The 1x Ringers you used so far was 113 mM NaCl. 5.1 Preparation What is the concentration of Na+-ions in 1x Ringer’s? To test if the ion transport depends on the concentration of Na+-ions, we will need the following solutions: Calculate the different concentrations of Na+-ions yourself and enter them in the excel sheet. Plan how to prepare 200 mL of each of these solutions from 1x or 2x Ringer’s. Once you have a plan find an instructor to approve and hand you the solutions. 5.2 Take measurments Empty chamber Using the 0x solution, wash the chamber on the mucosal side 3 times (wait 2 minutes in-between). Measure I and note it in your excel sheet. Repeat step 1-3 for each of the solutions in order of increasing Na+-ion concentration. 5.3 Data Analysis in R part 1 Convert I to the flux of Na+-ions (J) using the following relationship (F: Farraday constant): \\(J_{Na^+} = \\frac {I_{Na^+}}{F} = \\frac {1\\frac {C} {s}} {96500 \\frac {C} {mol}}\\) Plot J as a function of Na+-concentration. 5.4 Discussion part 1 Have you seen a curve like that before? What is it called? What kind of information can you extract from these curves? 5.5 Data Analysis in R part 2 Together: use to methods to extract Vmax and Km. Nonlinear curve fitting to the MM-curve itself Generate a Lineweaver Burk plot and extract both values. 5.6 Discussion part 2 Collect the results from all groups. Discuss the differences. What does Km express? What does Vmax express? For the report: Give an estimate of how fast the transport (in % of Vmax) takes place when a frog is sitting in its watering hole, with a Na+-concentration of approximately 5 mmol/L.
